# YULU-Demand-Analysis
Overview:

This project focuses on identifying the factors influencing the demand for Yulu's shared electric cycles in the Indian market. Through hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, the project aims to provide actionable insights to help Yulu enhance revenue and market performance.

Project Objective:

- Investigate the variables that significantly impact the demand for Yulu's electric cycles.
- Assess the effectiveness of these variables in explaining fluctuations in demand.
- Provide strategic recommendations to improve Yulu's market performance.
  
Data:

The dataset includes various features such as season, weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and rental counts, which are analyzed to determine their effect on the demand for electric cycles.

Key Features:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values and converted appropriate data types for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
3. Hypothesis Testing:
   - Conducted several hypothesis tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests, to determine the impact of factors like working days, weather, and seasons on cycle rentals.
     
Insights:

- Holiday Effect: Slightly increased bike rentals are observed during holidays, suggesting that special promotions during these times could further boost demand.
- Seasonal Trends: Higher bike rental activity is noted during the summer and fall seasons, indicating that these periods should be the focus of marketing efforts.
- Weather Conditions: The majority of bike rentals occur under clear or partly cloudy conditions, while there is a notable decrease in rentals during adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, or high humidity.
- Temperature Impact: Rentals decrease significantly when the temperature falls below 10°C, and similar trends are observed when windspeed exceeds 35 km/h.
Correlation Insights: A strong correlation was found between the 'registered' and 'count' variables, suggesting that registered users are a key segment for Yulu’s business.

Recommendations:

1. Holiday Promotions: Implement special promotions or incentives during holidays to capitalize on the observed increase in demand.
2. Seasonal Marketing: Focus marketing campaigns and partnerships on the summer and fall seasons when bike rental activity peaks.
3. Weather-Responsive Operations: Adjust bike availability and maintenance schedules based on weather forecasts to optimize resource allocation during high-demand periods.
4. Weather-Triggered Promotions: Offer discounts or promotions during less favorable weather conditions (e.g., light rain or snow) to encourage usage during these times.
5. Dynamic Pricing: Introduce dynamic pricing based on weather conditions and other factors to better align rental prices with demand.
6. Service Diversification: Consider offering weather-appropriate bike options, such as e-bikes with weather protection, to maintain demand during adverse conditions.
7. Infrastructure Investment: Develop indoor or protected bike stations at key locations to attract users during extreme weather conditions.
